      Muhammed and I trained together during our time at Northcoders and worked together on several small projects. It was always a pleasure to work with Muhammed, both because of his strong coding ability and his fantastic people skills. Working through tough problems with him was always a fun, informative experience and he is a naturally analytical, creative problem solver who clearly loves to learn and is driven to understand the tools he works with deeply and thoroughly. Muhammed is able to explain his thought processes in a clear and approachable way and fosters a really friendly, fun and collaborative environment during paired projects. He is full of creative ideas and is always open to trying the ideas of others, and was supportive of myself and other trainees even when we were working on different projects, providing valuable guidance and help for tough problems. I know that any organisation that he works for will be lucky to have him - he's a brilliant problem solver and a brilliant colleague.`,
